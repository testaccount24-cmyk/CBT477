//***FILE 477 is from Brandon Hill and contains a program,          *   FILE 477
//*           called AWSUTIL, which takes MVS data from either      *   FILE 477
//*           disk or tape, and creates a "virtual tape file"       *   FILE 477
//*           in AWS format.  This file, which contains all the     *   FILE 477
//*           data normally in a complete tape, can then be         *   FILE 477
//*           electronically sent anywhere.  You no longer have     *   FILE 477
//*           to ship a physical tape.                              *   FILE 477
